# I consider the dotfiles complete. Don't expect any updates. I might start a new repository, but this will stop being active.

This are my personal dotfiles, for i3.

Dependencies are:
```
i3 polybar alacritty rofi vim picom nitrogen polkit-gnome pulseaudio
```
(Running install.sh installs them if a detected package manager is found)

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thecaprisun/dots/main/install.sh | bash
```
(You need to have `git` and `curl` installed for the script to work)
